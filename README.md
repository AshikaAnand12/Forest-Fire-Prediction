# ForestFirePrediction
The main objective of this project is to generate the confidence level at which the forest fire may occur in near future and the percentage of forest fire that takes place at that specified location and time.


## Data Sources:
* NASA Earth: https://nrt3.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/FIRMS/modis-c6.1/Global

## Working

- Retrived Data from the data sources
- Perform the data cleaning and Pre-processing
- Extract features which are neccesary for building the model
- Implement different visualization techniques
- Create a Model with the pre-processed data
- Check the accuarcy and select model
- Dump the model into pickle file
- Use the pickle file for deployment in AWS EC2 instance 
- Fetch the data from deployment and pass it to the developed UI to generate the required results



## Understanding and Conclusion
We have come to a conclusion that, the analysis and prediction of forest fires acknowledges everyone when to take preventive measures without having loss of life or resources. By predicting the future, this system will definitely benefit to stop at least a few destructions caused by forest fires.
